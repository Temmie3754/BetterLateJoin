# BetterLateJoin
 
An SCP:SL EXILED plugin allowing players to spawn in as configurable roles if they join late.

With this plugin you can set the amount of time to give players to join after the round has started and change what roles they can spawn in as.
When running please ensure the base-game late join is off in the gameplay config so no conflicts can occur.
In the config roles must be formatted correctly to work.
